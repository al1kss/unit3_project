## Q1. What was the most proud moment for you during this project?
My app. I really was enjoying coding an application for the pizza place. I believe it actually looks good, and I spent a lot of time working on the design of the app.

## Q2. What worked well this time?
Using inheritance in KivyMD to not write the same code over and over again. And for easy addition of new items to database and to the app.

## Q3. What will you do different for Unit 4/IA?
I will start working early on the project. It worked well for Unit Project 2. However, this time I neglected this crucial part. I will start working on Unit 4, as soon as I will get the assignment, finish early and relax after.

## What do you need help with?
I need help with documentations. I believe that if I will spend more time I can perfect the documentation, however if we will see good examples of the project in the beginning. We can look up to it and greatly improve the end result.
