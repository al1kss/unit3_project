# Unit 3: Restaraunt Manager

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
I require a restaurant management application that streamlines inventory tracking, automates buffet orders, and provides real-time supplier updates. The primary goal is to simplify operations and ensure efficient management as I plan to expand my restaurant business. Currently, the lack of a centralized system makes it challenging to monitor every detail effectively. A user-friendly app that consolidates all management tasks into one platform would significantly enhance productivity and support my growth objectives.

## Proposed Solution


## Success Criteria
1. Track inventory for ingredients, fully prepared meals (e.g., frozen food), and baked goods (e.g., cakes). Include real-time updates on stock levels and ingredient costs.
2. Enable employee check-in and check-out with timestamps.
3. Provide a scheduling system for employee shifts.
4. Log every order with timestamps, table numbers, assigned waitstaff, and order type (dine-in, take-out, or delivery platforms like DoorDash). (it will register when staff registers an order)
5. Track profits over time, identify best-selling products, and calculate profit margins.
6. Log expenses (e.g., property rent, employee wages) and provide financial summaries.
7. Allow customers to make reservations through the app.
8. Enable restaurant staff to view and manage reservations.
9. Implement a secure login system with different access levels (owner, manager, staff).
10. Restrict access to financial data to authorized personnel only.
11. Track supplier orders, including stock arrival dates and prices.
12. Automatically update inventory based on supplier deliveries.
13. Consolidate all management tasks into a single, intuitive platform accessible via one device.
